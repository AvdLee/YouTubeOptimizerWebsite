        <h2>What Data We Access</h2>
        <p>
          To provide optimization features, the app uses the YouTube Data API and YouTube Analytics API to
          fetch video content, performance metrics, and channel information for the logged-in YouTube
          account. We also receive identifiers needed for authentication (such as your Google account and
          channel IDs) limited to the scopes you approve. Only data necessary to support these features is
          requested; we do not collect data unrelated to YouTube channel optimization.
        </p>

        <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
        <p>
          Retrieved data is used to analyze performance and propose improvements. When you choose to apply
          changes, the app updates video metadata (such as titles, descriptions, tags, and thumbnails)
          through the YouTube APIs based on your interactions in the app. Data is used only to provide and
          improve Vydio features; it is not sold, used for advertising, or shared for unrelated purposes.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Sharing with Third-Party AI Services</h2>
        <p>
          Some data returned from YouTube APIs may be processed by third-party AI tools, including OpenAI
          APIs, to generate suggestions and metadata updates. These providers act as processors on our
          behalf, use the data only to support the requested improvements, and do not receive ownership of
          your content. We do not allow these providers to use your data for training unrelated models or
          for advertising.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>How We Protect Your Data</h2>
        <p>
          We use industry-standard encryption in transit and restrict access to authorized team members who
          need it to operate the service. Access tokens and sensitive data are stored securely and scoped to
          the minimum required permissions.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
        <p>
          We retain YouTube data and related analysis only as long as needed to provide the optimization
          features you request or to meet legal obligations. You can disconnect your YouTube account at any
          time; upon disconnection or a deletion request, we remove stored access tokens and purge related
          cached data. To request deletion, contact us at support@vydio.app.

        <h2>Performance Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>
          The app aims to improve channel performance by following industry best practices and YouTube
          recommendations. Outcomes may vary, and the app cannot be held responsible for decreased
          performance, including situations where user choices (for example, drastic manual changes to
          descriptions or hashtags) reduce results.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Your Choices</h2>
        <p>
          You may disconnect your YouTube account at any time. You are responsible for reviewing suggested
          changes before they are applied and for complying with YouTube policies and applicable laws.
